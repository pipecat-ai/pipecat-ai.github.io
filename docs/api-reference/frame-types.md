# Frame Types

There are a variety of different kinds of frames used in the SDK. Rather than document them here, it's worth looking at [frames.py in the framework itself](https://github.com/daily-co/daily-ai-sdk/blob/3528f5d7356767a138e4b14a26c24f1809ae0b20/src/dailyai/pipeline/frames.py), since it contains good docstrings describing each one.
